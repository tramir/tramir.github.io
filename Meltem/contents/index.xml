  <about_me><![CDATA[
    I am an Associate Professor in the <a href="http://www.sdu.dk/en/Om_SDU/Institutter_centre/Ivoe_virksomhedsledelse_og_oekonomi" target="_blank">Department of Business and Economics</a> at the University of Southern Denmark and a Research Fellow at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iza.org/en/webcontent/index_html">IZA</a>. I received my B.A. in Economics from Bogazici University in 2003, and my Ph.D. in Economics from University of Maryland, College Park in 2009. I currently serve as an associate editor at <em><a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-health-economics" target="_blank">Journal of Health Economics</a></em> and the chief coordinator of <a href="https://www.sdu.dk/en/om_sdu/institutter_centre/ivoe_virksomhedsledelse_og_oekonomi/forskning/satsningsomraader/nhe_homepage" target="_blank">Network on Health Economics</a>. My research agenda lies at the intersection of health economics, labor economics, and economic demography. I teach health economics at the graduate level and econometric methods at the upper undergraduate level.
