I am an associate professor in the Department of Business and Economics at the University of Southern Denmark and a Research Fellow at IZA. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2009.

My primary research interests are in applied microeconomics, particularly labor and health economics. My recent work looks into the returns to medical interventions, particularly early in life.

I have taught graduate labor economics and econometrics, as well as various courses at the undergraduate level.
