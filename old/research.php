            <p id="abstract">While many studies examine the effect of primary education quality on labor market outcomes 
            in developing countries, little is known about the effects at higher levels. We exploit the quasi-experiment 
            provided by a large-scale education reform launched in Senegal in 2000 to investigate how quality improvements 
            at the university level affect employment. Our difference-in-difference estimates suggest that young 
            high-skilled workers experienced a nine percentage-point employment gain relative to older workers. They are 
            also more likely to have &ldquo;better&rdquo; jobs (in the service industry or government), suggesting a 
            reduction in the mismatch between the quality of high-skill labor demanded and supplied.</p>

            of the legal recognition of same-sex couples (through marriage or an alternative institution) on different-sex 
            marriage, divorce, and extramarital births. Estimates from difference-in-difference models indicate that the 
            introduction of same-sex marriage or of alternative institutions has no negative effects on family formation.
            These findings are robust to a multitude of specification checks, including the construction of counterfactuals

            <p id="abstract">It has long been argued that the legalization of same-sex marriage would have a negative impact
            on marriage. In this article, I examine how different-sex marriage in the Netherlands was affected by the 
            enactment of two laws: a 1998 law that provided all couples with an institution almost identical to marriage (a 
            "registered partnership") and a 2001 law that legalized same-sex marriage for the first time in the world. I 
            first construct a synthetic control for the Netherlands using OECD data for the period 1988–2005 and find that 
            neither law had significant effects on either the overall or different-sex marriage rate. I next construct a 
            unique individual-level data set covering the period 1995–2005 by combining the Dutch Labor Force Survey and 
            official municipal records. The estimates from a discrete-time hazard model with unobserved heterogeneity for
            the first-marriage decision confirm the findings in the aggregate analysis. The effects of the two laws are 
            heterogeneous, with presumably more-liberal individuals (as defined by their residence or ethnicity) marrying 
            less after passage of both laws and potentially more-conservative individuals marrying more after passage of 
            each law.</p>

            <p id="abstract">Although Kenya's financial system is by far the largest and most developed in East Africa and

            stability, efficiency, and outreach of Kenya's banking system, using aggregate, bank-level, and survey data. 
            Banks' asset quality and liquidity positions have improved, making the system more resistant to shocks, and 
            interest rate spreads have declined, in part due to reduction in the overhead costs of foreign banks. Outreach 
            remains limited, but has improved in recent years, driven by mobile payments services in the domestic 
            remittance market. Fostering a level regulatory playing field for all deposit-taking institutions is a key 
            remaining challenge. Specifically, an effective but not overly burdensome framework for regulation and 
            supervision of microfinance institutions and cooperatives is a priority. Maintaining an openness to new, and 
            non-bank, providers of financial services, which has enabled the success of mobile payments, could also further 
            outreach.</p>

            gestational week 37. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find no health benefits from additional 
            treatments for average newborns. However, there is substantial heterogeneity in returns to treatments, with 
            significant health benefits for newborns in the lowest income quartile and no benefits in higher income quartiles. 
            We provide suggestive evidence that potential difficulties in risk screening among low-income women cause this 
            heterogeneity. ``Back-of-the-envelope'' calculations suggest that providing additional treatments to all low-risk

            be highly cost-effective.</p>

            in the previous literature that children who are slightly below the VLBW cutoff have better short- and long-term
            health, and higher math test scores in 9th grade. We next investigate spillover effects on siblings and find no
            evidence of an impact on their health outcomes. However, we find substantial positive spillovers on all our
            measures of academic achievement. Our estimates suggest that siblings of focal children who were slightly below
            the VLBW cutoff have higher 9th grade language and math test scores, as well as higher probability of enrolling
            in a high school by age 19. Our results suggest that improved interactions within the family may be an important
            pathway behind the observed spillover effects.</p>

            <p id="abstract">We investigate the impact of obstetrician supervision, as opposed to midwife supervision, on the 
            health of low-risk newborns. We exploit a unique policy rule in the Netherlands that creates a large discontinuity
            in the probability of a low-risk birth being attended by an obstetrician at gestational week 37. Using a fuzzy
            regression discontinuity design, we consistently find no health benefits from obstetrician supervision, despite 
            increased neonatal intensive care unit admission rates among births supervised by obstetricians. These results 
            indicate potential cost savings from shifting supervision of low-risk deliveries, which represent the vast majority 
            of all births, from obstetricians to midwives.</p>
